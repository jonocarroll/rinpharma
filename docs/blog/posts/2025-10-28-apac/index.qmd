The APAC Track organising committee is excited to announce that the
Asia-Pacific (APAC) Track returns for the free and virtual R/Pharma 2025
conference!

## What?

R/Pharma is a scientifically and industry-oriented, collegial online conference
focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals, with breakout
in-person and APAC satellite events. After a successful introduction last year, 
we are once again hosting a track which is better aligned with the Asia-Pacific 
region - anyone for whom midday GMT+8 (Â±3) is a comfortable time.

## Who?

Attending? Hopefully YOU! But a conference like this doesn't happen by accident, 
so your thanks for pulling everything together goes to the organising committee(s) 
who put in the hard work of designing the schedule, reviewing and approving 
submitted talks, hosting sessions, etc.
